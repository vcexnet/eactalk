## Completely decentralized

Unlike other iOS eacpay wallets, **Eacpay wallet** is a standalone Earthcoin client. It connects directly to the Earthcoin network using [SPV](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security#Header-Only_Clients) mode, and doesn't rely on servers that can be hacked or disabled. Even if eacpay wallet is removed from the App Store, the app will continue to function, allowing users to access their valuable Earthcoin at any time.

## Cutting-edge security

**eacpay wallet** utilizes AES hardware encryption, app sandboxing, and the latest iOS security features to protect users from malware, browser security holes, and even physical theft. Private keys are stored only in the secure enclave of the user's phone, inaccessible to anyone other than the user.

## Designed with new users in mind

Simplicity and ease-of-use is **Eacpay wallet**'s core design principle. A simple recovery phrase (which we call a paper key) is all that is needed to restore the user's wallet if they ever lose or replace their device. **Eacpay wallet** is [deterministic](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki), which means the user's balance and transaction history can be recovered just from the paper key.

## Features:

- ["simplified payment verification"](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0037.mediawiki) for fast mobile performance
- no server to get hacked or go down
- single backup phrase that works forever
- private keys never leave your device
- import [password protected](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0038.mediawiki) paper wallets
- ["payment protocol"](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0070.mediawiki) payee identity certification
